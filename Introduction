# Bayesian-Structural-Time-Series
Bayesian Structural Time Series Implementation with Google Trends, sentiment analysis, and econometric data

Originally developed for Fabletics' marketing analytics, this implementation incorporates client data on marketing spend, impressions, and customer acquisitions to create a wholistic view of the economic and social media context in which the business operates. Alternative data was sourced from Google Trends, Facebook's Graph API, the Federal Reserve's econometrics database.
